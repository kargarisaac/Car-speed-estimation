# Car-speed-estimation
In this work, I will apply some approaches to estimate speed of a car using front camera videos and some deep learning architectures such as Nvidia model, pre-trained vgg16 and fine tuning, recurrent convolutional neural networks, and 3d convolutional neural nets(if my Laptop allow me!).
